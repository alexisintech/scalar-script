# V1

This v1 folder is the permanent holder for all api routes and 
service logic.

Historically, we used path-based api versioning, and included
this v1 folder structure to match it.
Now, we use query and header based versioning (see RFC HERE:
https://www.notion.so/clerkdev/API-Versioning-0d88e8eb4e2240f9afae4618930c534a?pvs=4
), but this folder remains our home for api logic.
